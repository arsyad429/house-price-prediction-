# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on input data provided in a `.json` file format using a trained machine learning model.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Joblib
- JSON

## 🔍 Features
- Predict house prices based on user input (via JSON file)
- Trained with basic regression algorithm
- Simple UI using Streamlit
- Workflow notebook (`mlWorkFlow.ipynb`) to show model training process

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Clone this repository**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

2. **Install the required dependencies**
pip install numpy pandas joblib streamlit

3. **Run the app**
streamlit run app.py

4. **(Optional) Explore the notebook**
You can open mlWorksFlow.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to see how the model was built and trained.
